    <h1>A year at Mozilla</h1>
<time datetime="2016-05-05T14:10:00+02:00">Thu 05 May 2016</time></header>
<article>
    <p>When I started the draft of this article, I had spent a year at Mozilla. Now it
has been a year and a half, but the post title would be less cool.</p>
<p><strong>tdlr; An amazing experience so far, a lot happened already. Working remotely is
hard. Being pragmatic and satisfy everyone expectations is impossible.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="the-transition">
<h2>The transition</h2>
<div class="section" id="barcelona">
<h3>Barcelona</h3>
<p>The city is very pleasant, the weather is amazing — it never rains basically.</p>
<p>Being far from close friends is very hard. But I knew moving to Barcelona was
not going to be a problem in itself since I speak Spanish and a little
bit of Catalan.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the Mediterrean culture and gastronomy, and had a lot of
interesting conversations and fascinating debates about politics, especially
with regards to the Catalan independance.</p>
<p>Although the new mayor is making a lot of great infrastructure improvements
for pushing the bicycles forward, it is still a very noisy and contaminated
environment. Car drivers are still in velvet.</p>

<div class="section" id="working-remotely">
<h3>Working remotely</h3>
<p>Leaving the collocial office of Makina Corpus in Toulouse and working as
a full remotee was definitely the most impacting life change.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/twitter-quote-remote.png" />
<p>From previous experencies as a freelancer, I was aware of my inabilty to
keep a discipline when working from home.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/areskib">Areski</a> I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.betahaus.es/mathieu-leplatre/">landed at Betahaus</a>,
probably the best place to work from! This building is full of awesome people
from all around the world, working in very distinct areas, from journalism
to wood craving through cartoonists and photographs.</p>
<p>Still, interacting on a daily basis with remote colleagues through video
calls and IRC can sometimes be very frustrating. Especially when the Internet connection
is flaky, when proprietary software suck badly on Linux (<em>I'm looking at you Vidyo</em>)
or when a cacophonous horde of motorcycles hijacks your microphone.</p>
<p>Timezones are also challenging :) Since Mozilla employees are spread around the world,
it's not rare to extend the work day of a few hours in order to get in touch
with colleagues! I can't complain, everything has been very flexible so far.</p>
<p>Favorably, Mozilla offers us the possibility to travel and meet regularly. We make
our best to organize small workshops several times per quarter, in addition to the
gatherings of the whole company twice a year. Those are super fun and extremely
productive!</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="maintaining-former-projects">
<h3>Maintaining former projects</h3>
<p>As part of the transition, I had to withdraw from the several open-source projects
<a class="reference external" href="http://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/2013/geotrek-histoire-dun-projet-libre">I maintained while at Makina Corpus</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, giving up on something you had cherished for years is delicate. Emotions
come in the way.</p>
<p>Some projects were not receiving the love and attention they deserved and that made
me sad. But I realized I couldn't continue to watch them all and suffered from not
being able to provide thorough answers on issues and questions.</p>
<p>I begged for help or support several times along the year, and eventually I left them :|
That's perhaps part of the open-source darwinism.</p>
<p>By the way, Janis' <a class="reference external" href="https://jazzband.co">Jazzband project</a> is awesome! Think about it
instead of using the Github organization of your current company...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chocolate-factory">
<h3>Chocolate factory</h3>
<p>Working for an organization that has a good image everywhere around the globe
is quite rewarding of course (...a typical reaction: <em>«Oh really! I use it at home,
Firefox is the best search engine to send emails on Facebook»</em>).</p>
<p>I remember very well the feeling of pride when I first came to the Mozilla
office in Paris. Impressed by its stairs covered with a giant fox logo, I felt like
I wasn't up to the job!</p>
<img alt="CC-BY-SA Robert Kaiser https://www.flickr.com/photos/kairo_at/22208348283/" src="images/mozilla-paris-stairs.jpg" />
<p>The welcoming workmates there helped lowering the pressure quickly.
By the way, special thanks to the teams in charge of the different
offices, they are amazing! Being so spoiled sometimes makes me feel disconcerted!</p>
<p>After a year, I somehow got used to the idea. But I must admit that I still
feel some pride when my 3 years old kid shouts out <em>«Daddy's wooooork!»</em> as soon as he spots
the browser logo :)</p>
<p>Still, the popular <em>impostor syndrome</em> is on watch: my coworkers are the best engineers
in the world! A lot of them have their name in the W3C standards, and some have
their own Wikipedia page!</p>

<h3>Trolling the giants</h3>
<p>If you think Mozilla is just the editor of a declining browser, please take
some time to read <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2015/12/08/the-power-of-mozilla/">the power of Mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>There are a lot of expectations towards the organization. Lots of affection, concern, hope,
and disappointment obviously. This leads to very strong criticism and attacks, which
sometimes seem rather unfair. When you look at the overall landscape, who is the enemy?</p>
<img alt="" src="images/twitter-quote-reaction.png" />
<p>Now that I am within the organization I understand what is at stake. Especially
when considering the difference of size with the competitors (~100x). It does not
mean I agree with every decision, but I grasp why concessions are necessary.</p>

<div class="section" id="storage-team">
<h2>Storage team</h2>
<p>I could not have joined a more desirable team. Our history takes its roots a long
time ago. We've known each others for years! <a class="reference external" href="http://ziade.org">Tarek</a>'s books about Python were major
pieces while I was learning, <a class="reference external" href="https://notmyidea.org">Alex</a> was a trainee at Makina Corpus when I arrived
there 6 years ago, <a class="reference external" href="https://nicolas.perriault.net/">N1k0</a> was one of the organizers of the fantastic &quot;DjangoCong&quot; 2012
edition, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Natim">Natim</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://mathieu.agopian.info">magopian</a> were awesome comrades during DjangoCon Toulouse four years ago...</p>
<p>We are all aligned on the vision we have for decentralizing the Web, we work in the
same timezone, we all speak French and we share the same taste for exquisite
home-made food and beverages :)</p>
<p>I shall also mention <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/michielbdejong">Michiel</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/glasserc">Ethan</a>
who joined the team recently!</p>
<p>By the way, check out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/">our blog</a>, in French and English.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/london-team-selfie.jpg" />
<div class="section" id="organization">
<h3>Organization</h3>
<p>Since we mostly work on backend stuff, we don't suffer too much from release agenda
and marketing communication. The server can usually be upgraded transparently
and our priorities reassessed depending of the present meteorology.</p>
<p>We have precise goals for the current quarter, but we are mostly self-organized.
The open-source aspect of our work is an important property but the main purpose
is still to serve internal needs. Everything we do to make Kinto a community project
for example requires a lot of extra efforts and willpower.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, shipping features on the server-side is usually a lot easier than what
other teams handle on the client-side: we treat with one operating system, deploy one main version,
can introspect the server remotely and monitor internal details without too much pain.</p>
<p>We don't do much of agile ceremonials. Maybe because we work remotely. Also maybe because
we haven't designated anyone as a proper product owner.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="our-first-project">
<h3>Our first project</h3>
<p>When I joined the team, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/hello/">Firefox Hello</a>
had just been put in production, and the team was responsible for the server part:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/loop-server">Loop server</a>.
The server handles Websockets and handshakes using NodeJS and Redis.
Fixing bugs and implementing minor features was possibly the best opportunity
for me to dig into this project.</p>
<p>One of the first goals that came up was to build <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/service-de-nuages">a readinglist service</a>, a sort
of alternative to Pocket. We succeeded in setting up a stack, deploying and scaling
it quite rapidly, working sometimes late at night. Since we wanted to capitalize on all the efforts we had done
(API design, scaling, ...) we created <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/why-cliquet">a toolkit called Cliquet</a>.
I could talk about it at <a class="reference external" href="http://mozilla-services.github.io/cliquet/talks/2015.07.pybcn/">PyBCN</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://mozilla-services.github.io/cliquet/talks/2015.10.pyconfr/">Pycon-FR</a>.</p>
<p>We even hacked on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability">readability</a>, a JavaScript library
that transforms a webpage into plain text. Maybe you executed it already if you used the <a class="reference external" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">Firefox Reader Mode</a>.
Before joining our team officially, N1k0 made a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/readinglist-client">full-Web version of a readinglist app</a> :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the readinglist project was shutdown at the last moment. That was hard to take,
and we had quite a hard time recovering from this disappointment.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/big-chair.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="booting-kinto">
<h3>Booting Kinto</h3>
<p>We revamped the readinglist server code and saw an opportunity to bring back our idea of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/generic-storage-ecosystem">a generic remote storage</a>.
Our first concrete use-case was a prototype
for a payment and subscription service, which became a pretext to implement a fine-grained
permissions API into our newly born Kinto.</p>

<p>Daybed never became a Mozilla project, but its concepts were all re-implemented
in Kinto!</p>
<p>Last summer, Firefox OS had no way to synchronize bookmarks and browsing history
accross devices. We built <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js">kinto.js</a>, a JavaScript
client for Kinto, focused on offline capabilities and records synchronization.
Personally, I learned a lot from this project. N1k0 was leading us towards modern
and elegant patterns in JavaScript, and we could get our hands dirty with IndexedDB.</p>
<p>As a side project I could spend some time on an offline-first Web app, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/leplatrem/Routina/">Routina</a>,
for which we did <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-react-boilerplate/">a Kinto+React boilerplate</a>.</p>
<img alt="" src="images/orlando-kinto-meeting.jpg" />
<p>We saw an opportunity to spread Kinto within the organization with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/summer-perspectives">Go Faster initiative</a>, which consists in shipping
settings, content and features quicker that the 6-weeks release cycle.</p>
<p>We even <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/servicedenuages.fr/blob/7a3edb700d46b41207a8df97b6341f184818732c/content/2016.02.localisation-service.md">did some experiments</a>
to have the <a class="reference external" href="https://kinto-ota.dev.mozaws.net/attachments/demo.mp4">UI translations shipped asynchronously</a>!</p>
<p>Kinto was <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10733164">featured</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10994736">twice</a> on Hackernews, and referred as an alternative
to Parse and Firebase! This was both exciting and stressful, especially because it was my
first experience of heavy exposure — unlike Tarek, N1k0 or Alexis who had lead notorious
open source projects before, and already knew the downsides ;)</p>
<p>The funny part was someone saying <em>«Google has Firebase, Apple has Cloudkit,
Facebook has Parse, now Mozilla has Kinto»</em>: how do we reply that we are only a few
folks hacking cool stuff and that top-management is probably not even aware of it?</p>

<div class="section" id="coming-next">
<h3>Coming next</h3>
<p>In 2016, we now have Kinto instances <a class="reference external" href="https://firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com">running in production</a>,
and about to be used by millions of users to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/kinto-file-attachment">deliver assets of Firefox mobile</a>,
or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.servicedenuages.fr/en/data-signature">revoke SSL certificates</a>.
It was a great opportunity to grow the eco-system, with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-admin/">a Web admin UI</a>
for example!</p>

&gt; I'm not likely to hack the C++ codebase of Firefox/Gecko, even though I
&gt; could and would if it was necessary.
&gt;
</pre>
<p>Well, here you go! In the last few months, I've spent a good proportion of my time
contributing to Gecko. We want to replace the existing system based on a big XML file
downloaded every day with a sweet diff-based synchronization of JSON (<a class="reference external" href="http://ziade.org/2016/02/22/kinto-work-week-recap/">more info...</a>).</p>
<p>On top of that, Kinto could become the key component for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/storage-sync">storage.sync API</a>
implementation in Gecko, which would bring the <a class="reference external" href="http://arewewebextensionsyet.com">Web Extension compability table</a> close
to 100%. As Michiel (founder of <a class="reference external" href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a>) said: this is really exciting because it would offer a decentralized
remote storage with encryption support to everybody — <em>contrary to the one offered by Google by the way</em>.</p>
<p>One of the next challenges will presumably be related to horizontal scaling for
massive usage of writable instances. We could also imagine integrating
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-webpush/">WebPush notifications</a>
which landed in Firefox 44 and Chrome 42.</p>
<p>Whether Kinto will replace the existing Sync server or not, it is completely uncertain
and would require quite a big amount of work. Although that could make sense :)</p>
<p>Mozilla has a lot of exciting projects in the pipeline, like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/servo/servo/">Servo</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mozilla/tofino">Tofino</a>, which will gain visibility in the
coming months, and could benefit from having a synchronized remote storage!</p>
