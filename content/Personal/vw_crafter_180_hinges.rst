I'm writing this post in the hope that it will be indexed and accessible to anyone searching for 180-degree hinges for a Volkswagen Crafter (2017-) or MAN TGE.

Finding these hinges was a nightmare!

My van originally came with 270-degree hinges, which are not compatible with heavy items like bike racks. The mounting manual for my bike carrier clearly states this. The wide-opening door hinge wouldn't hold the bike carrier securely.

I naively thought I could just go to my VW retailer and order them.

The first obstacle was that Volkswagen wouldn't let me contact official mechanics without making an appointment and bringing in the actual vehicle. Crazy, right?

It took me months, and after consulting three different garages and several technicians, I was told that no other hinges were available besides the default ones. These guys simply enter my van's serial number into their system, and the conversation ends there. So frustrating.

I found `some <https://cjlleisure.co.uk/product/vw-crafter-man-tge-high-strength-barn-door-hinges/>`_ `hinges <https://mulevans.co.uk/products/man-crafter-180-degree-hinges>`_ online from the UK, but they were painted black, and either didn't ship to Spain or were prohibitively expensive. Months later, I saw a *Volkswagen Grand California* at a music festival. It's built on a *Crafter* frame and sold by Volkswagen, not by car preparers. It had a bike carrier, and the door had different hinges than mine! But the folks who had rented it for the weekend left before I could ask them for details.

I started looking for these vans everywhere, but they are quite rare around here since they are pretty pricey. Weeks later, I finally met another *Grand California* owner. Unfortunately, he wasn't comfortable giving me the full serial number of his van, and I didn't want to push it. However, he gave me the contact information for the garage that sells them: `Catalunya Van <https://catalunyavan.com/>`_. I spoke to a wonderful person there who agreed to provide a full serial number for one of these models.

Back at Volkswagen with the new serial number, I still had no luck. They refused to help because the number didn't match my van. Just as I was about to lose my temper, they suggested contacting a spare parts provider: `Pro Service <https://proservice.es/>`_. Incredible! I didn't have to explain anything, and to my surprise, they had the hinges in stock!

They cost me â‚¬120 each and were unpainted.

Painting them cost me a few more bucks since I don't have a spray gun.

Mounting them requires a `XZN Triple-square <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Multiple-square_drives>`_ screw drive of 12mm.
