I bought a van. Better said, I bought a truck and paid a company to turn it into a van.

My experience with the whole process, from finding a company to the final delivery, had lots in a common with someone non technical wanting a tailor made software.

Finding a company

- look at estestics
- serious?
- quality of email replies

Specifications

- 

Prototype

- very clear vision from drawing on the ground
- imposible to understand volumes

Pictures

- see it but cannot interact with it
- lack of body size

Delivery

- Waterfall

Support

- Trying out things
- lack of FAQ
