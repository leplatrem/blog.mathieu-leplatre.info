When I hear "self-service", the first thing that comes to my mind is a restaurant without waitstaff, where customers push their tray through a line of options, help themselves, and check out at the cashier, most likely a human that will double check and sum everything.

In our team, we build internal services for other teams, and the more they can do on their own, the less they wait for us, the faster they are served, and the less we have to "switch context".

This article presents some ideas and reflexions around the concept of *self service* in our little world of software.


What does self-service mean?
----------------------------

What is not self-service? 

1. I need something
2. I open a ticket
3. The ticket is put in a backlog
4. One or a few operators handle it
5. I receive what I asked

This is the usual experience at fast-foods. Latency at *Step 4* being reduced to its maximum with a lot of coordination and pressure on workers.

In companies, you're very likely to face this process too, because only a few administrators have the necessary privileges to get you what you want. 

Believe it or not, but I've seen projects where onboarding a new instance of a product consisted in waiting for engineers to modify the source code and then operators to redeploy the service and migrate the database schema. Days of work. Mostly coordination latency.

It may seem obvious, but ideally this is what we want:

1. I need something
2. I follow step-by-step instructions
4. I receive it

Between *Step 2* and *Step 3*, there could be an additional approval step, which at most consists in a single action to reject or accept the request.  

In practice, self-service is not so obvious to implement.


Knowledge Base
--------------

This is like level 0 of self service. RTFD.

All procedures are documented in a company wiki, using FAQs, tutorials, cookbooks, in order to empower employees to find answers on their own.

If the documentation repository is very well-maintained and organized, it would globally work. But from my experience, content is usually outdated and hard to find. It takes a real job (archivist or filing clerk) to build good documentation.

With AI and local/specialized/domain-specific language models, there could be a lot of improvements with regards to querying and leveraging knowledge bases. Searching via keywords on Confluence is clearly not a panacea.


Self Service APIs
-----------------

Around 2002, Jeff Bezos told his employees to build APIs in order to enable teams to independently access and utilize each other's services without needing direct inter-team communication or coordination.

You need a database in prod? Just call the API to get it, ``POST /databases/prod/mydb``!

This is a great idea, that served as the foundations of AWS, and was probably one of the keystones to the company success. 

But concretely, how many companies did implement this concretely? Unless you're working at Google or Amazon, it's very likely that if you need a new sub-domain name for your app, you'll have to fill a Jira ticket üòè

This approach requires excellent documentation and API versioning. And I don't know how offering self service APIs would work for non-technical employees, for which it may not be obvious to perform tasks programmatically.


Graphical User Interfaces
-------------------------

At the other side of the spectrum: user interfaces. 

You build a (Web) UI where users can login, view and edit resources, submit their request, and obtain or wait for the result.

These user interfaces are extremely expensive to build:

- Intuitive design and user experience are crucial and too easy to get wrong;
- UI must adapt to users privileges;
- Likely to reinvent the wheel for review and approval workflows, comments and request status updates; 
- Web apps are toilsome to build and maintain (anyone maintaining a JS project with a dozen of dependencies knows that);

They make sense if a lot of users interact very often with it, especially if they are non-technical, but in some situations they will globally cost a lot more than the value they bring. Bad user interfaces can also be very frustrating and counter productive.


Chat bots
---------

In my daily life, I generally hate chats bots that pretend to be human. The other day, I received a Whatsapp bot message with some heath insurance details for someone else. Apparently this person's phone number had a typo, and I did my best to tell the remote machine that I had nothing to do with this, but there was no just way, it was not programmed for this situation apparently.

However, I find them extremely usually and handy when their dialogue interface is a finite list of commands.

In the context of self-service, we don't really need natural language. A list of possible operations and available options is a lot more efficient than a very bad immitation of a human waiter, or than a free text input box without guidance. 

Chat bots can walk us through a step-by-step journey, and would perfectly replace typical `multi-step forms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)>`_. 

Beyond basic Slack plugins and commands, I don't have too much experience with chat bots at work. I think we should do more with them, because compared to user interfaces, they are fairly easy and cheap to build. I did `one <https://github.com/leplatrem/ihatemoney-bot>`_ for Telegram years ago using a high level SDK, and it was fun to implement!


Files Driven Workflows
----------------------

This has been my favorite in the last years: files on a Git repository with a CI/CD pipeline.

1. You open a pull-request on a Git repository to make changes
2. An automated job verifies that they look sound
3. A human approves it
4. An automated job executes the pipeline, and you see the results immediately

CI/CD scripts are relatively cheap to implement, and platforms like Gitlab or Github are straightforward to work with.

The level of abstraction is what matters here. The CI/CD pipeline does not have to always be super smart. For example, the files can be mounted directly in the containers and read when the application starts. Or a script can read the files and execute calls on APIs each time they are modified. I personally like when the files are flat and easy to reason about, and it's not always the case with *configuration as code* where resources are sometimes spread in tiny YAML files.

Permissions management and security are also one of the main concerns. If you give the powers to make changes to your infrastructure to a CI/CD worker, you better make sure to have good management of secrets and fine access control (VPN, user-groups, ...).

Extensive linting would also be very recommended. A typo in a file, and you can end up replacing a resource by another without noticing! You can set up advanced solutions to execute dry runs or deploy temporary instances in order to give the reviewers better insights and more confidence in approving the changes.   

This approach has some limits if a lot of employees have to modify the same set of files (merge conflicts!), but there are workarounds and in most cases the frequency of changes on the same resource remains relatively low.


Do Less, Accomplish More
------------------------

I would definitely encourage you to consider implementing self-service solutions in your teams and organizations in order to design yourself out of the service operations. As usual, start small and iterate, combine different approaches if need, and focus on providing users the flexibility and convenience they need while also freeing up your support time and focus on other tasks.

As shown in this article, there are a lot of possible alternatives before investing a lot of resources in building complex Web user interfaces to enable self-service for your teams.
